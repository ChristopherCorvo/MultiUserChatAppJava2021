There are going to be messages that exchange between different parties. You are
going to have two parties Users and the Server. There communication can be modeled
as:

    1. User --> Server
        ++ Login / Logoff commands (focus of Ep2)
        ++ status

    2. Server --> User
        ++ online / offline messages: users are notified when new user logs in

    3. User --> User:
        ++ direct messages
        ++ broadcast messages to all users

Commands:
    ++ login <user> <password>
    ++ logoff
