There are going to be messages that exchange between different parties. You are
going to have two parties Users and the Server. There communication can be modeled
as:

    1. User --> Server
        ++ Login / Logoff commands (focus of Part2)
        ++ status

    2. Server --> User
        ++ online / offline messages: users are notified when new user logs in

    3. User --> User:
        ++ direct messages (Focus of Part3)
        ++ broadcast/group messages to all users (Focus of Part3) #

Commands:
    ++ login <user> <password>
    ++ logoff
    ++ msg <user> text....
        Example:
            guest: "msg jim Hello World" <-- sent
            jim: "msg guest Hello World" <-- received

    #topic <-- chatroom
        join #topic
        leave #topic
        send: msg #topic text.....
        recv: msg #topic:<login> text....
